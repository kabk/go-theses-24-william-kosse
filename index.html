            The dynamic, malleable nature of human memories, combined with their
            importance on our identity, emotional life and behaviour is
            dominated by an era of rapid technological progress. This thesis
            explores the complex relationship between technology and memory.
            Focusing on the themes of: transformative states of mind, cognitive
            disengagement, and the alienation experienced in the embrace of
            technological extensions. Human memory and technological influence
            blur boundaries.
            <br />
            <br />

            Encouraged by a reflection on the interaction that shapes the
            narrative of our collective memories. The text goes through the
            nuances of how our recollections are shaped, preserved and
            occasionally distorted by the omnipresence of digital tools. Memory
            is explored in the face of extended cognition and active
            externalism, in relation to the rapid growth and prevalence of
            artificial intelligence.
            <br />
            <br />

            Through the chapters, this symbiotic relationship is explored.
            Ranging from the nuanced connections between technology & memory to
            the psychological effects of technology-induced memory alterations.
            Memories, inter-minds, and the democratization of information is
            discussed. In contemplation of the future, the possibilities of
            Mechanically Extended Man and the intricacies of brain-computer
            interfaces are brought to light.

            The boundaries of memory have expanded into a complex interplay
            between human cognition and the external world, raising questions on
            where the mind ends and the environment begins. The concept of
            <span>extended cognition</span><sup>1</sup> reveals that human
            reasoning is typically dependent on environmental supports.
            <a id="Clark_return" href="#Clark">(Clark & Chalmers, 1998)</a> The
            notion of <span>active externalism</span><sup>2</sup> is embraced,
            allowing us to go beyond a limited understanding of the mind and
            impact the way scientific investigation is approached and conducted.
            The implications extend beyond understanding the topic at its
            particular context; they reshape our understanding of memory's
            formation, retention, and recall.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Internet has become the primary form of external or
            <span>transactive memory</span><sup>3</sup> in the age of
            information technology, which has altered the way information is
            stored and accessed collectively. In the study of the Google Effects
            on Memory, it is revealed that individuals, faced with knowledge
            gaps, instinctively turn to computers for information, treating them
            as external memory systems that can be accessed at any time.
            <a href="#Sparrow">(Sparrow et al., 2011)</a> This relationship with
            our digital tools has led to a transformation where individuals
            remember not just what they know but, where to find the information.
            <a href="#Sparrow">(Sparrow et al., 2011)</a>

            <br />
            <br />
            The concept of transactive memory, as studied by Daniel M. Wegner,
            extends beyond individual cognition to the collective. When
            individuals share information within a group, a
            <span>collective memory</span><sup>4</sup> system forms, creating a
            shared knowledge pool. <a href="#Ward">(Ward, 2013)</a> For
            instance, in a collaborative research project, team members with
            distinct expertise, like data analysis, design, and data
            manipulation, contribute their specialized knowledge to the group.
            Each team member serves as a repository of expertise in their
            respective fields, sharing and offloading information related to
            their skills with others in the team. This concept questions the
            conventional perspective that regards human memory as the ultimate
            form of information storage, introducing the idea of treating the
            Internet as a transactive memory system.
            <a href="#Ward">(Ward, 2013)</a> The evolution of this partnership
            is so profound that “the experience of losing our Internet
            connection becomes more and more like losing a friend.”
            <a href="#Sparrow">(Sparrow et al., 2011)</a> This analogy gives
            light to the emotional depth of our digital interactions. Through
            these implications we are led to question how this change affects
            our cognitive processes and the essence of our identity.
            <br />
            <br />
            This evolution comes with its complexities and consequences,
            according to the Google effect study, individuals who relied on
            information stored on a computer experienced a reduction in their
            ability to recall information.
            <a href="#Sparrow">(Sparrow et al., 2011)</a> This implies that,
            relying heavily on external memory systems, such as: computers,
            photos and maps, may lead to a diminished capacity for remembering
            information independently. The rise of the <span>Inter-mind</span
            ><sup>5</sup>
            challenges the very essence of individual identity, cognitive
            ability, whilst making us vulnerable to manipulation and at a bigger
            risk to loss of personal connection. The exploration of memory's
            nuanced connections with technology extends beyond academia into
            popular culture. The 'Black Mirror' episode 'The Entire History of
            You' is a dystopian narrative where memory, surveillance, and
            control intersect.
            <a href="#Black-Mirror">(‘Black Mirror’, 2024)</a> The episode
            portrays a society where memories are no longer ephemeral but are
            recorded and replayed, blurring the lines between present experience
            and past recollection. The ability to remember everything can be a
            double-edged sword, allowing for negative memories to be suppressed
            but also posing concerns about continuous surveillance as a means of
            control. <a href="#Robot">(Robot, 2023)</a> This problem can be
            reflected in world concerns, notably in China, where the government
            implemented a social credit system to monitor and manage its
            citizens – the system influences creates a society where that
            conforms to an ulterior motive. “The Entire History of You" serves
            as a warning, highlighting the potential consequences of integrating
            technology into various facets of our lives.
            <br />
            <br />

            Technological advancements not only enhance our memory by providing
            efficient tools for storing and retrieving information but also
            redefine how we remember through the outsourcing of memory functions
            to external systems like cloud storage. The concept of
            autobiographical memory takes centre stage. Technology enables us to
            selectively capture, document, and share specific moments, shaping
            our personal narratives. The digital era empowers individuals to
            curate and filter their autobiographical memories, influencing not
            only how we remember but also how we construct and present our life
            stories; societal and cultural shifts further normalise this
            phenomenon. This raises concerns about the balance between
            technological progression and the possible threat to psychological
            well-being. Hence, there is a pressing need to contemplate the dual
            nature of this advancement and examine the fundamental aspects of
            human existence within this interconnected relationship with
            technology.

            In a world increasingly shaped by technology, the interaction
            between our memories and digital spaces encourages contemplation
            about the consequences of these connections. It is important to take
            into account the effects of personalised information, automation,
            artificial intelligence, and the evolution of our relationship with
            technology.
            <br />
            <br />
            The personalised web and its impact on individual perspectives are
            revealed through Eli Pariser's book 'The Filter Bubble'. He argues
            that while the <span>democratisation of information</span
            ><sup>6</sup> was previously celebrated for eradicating centralised
            power, now it is raising concerns about the homogenisation of
            viewpoints. <a href="#Pariser">(Pariser, 2011)</a> In the field of
            online news consumption, the algorithmic curation of content
            threatens diversity, potentially isolating individuals within their
            own beliefs.
            <a href="#Dujeancourt">(Dujeancourt & Garz, 2023)</a> This suggests
            that within these <span>bubbles</span><sup>7</sup>, there is a
            tendency for only one's own viewpoints to be mirrored, limiting
            exposure to diverse perspectives and ideas. As such, we are
            confronted with the paradox of information access — while we gain
            immediate access to tailored content, we risk narrowing our exposure
            to diverse opinions and ideas. In this an era of tailored content
            delivery, the prevalence of automation contributes to an environment
            where algorithms shape our experiences.
            <br />
            <br />
            Brett Frischmann's TED <a href="#">(Frischmann, 2020)</a> talk dives
            into the <span>automation bias</span><sup>8</sup> and unexamined
            <span>techno-social engineering</span><sup>9</sup> that permeates
            various aspects of our lives. From automated responses in social
            media interactions to the integration of technology in education,
            the pervasive influence of automation challenges us to reconsider
            the unintended consequences of our reliance on technology.
            <a href="#">(Frischmann, 2020)</a> Our dependence on information
            retrieval may foster automation bias, reinforcing our existing
            belief and preferences whilst elevating the risk of narrowing our
            exposure to diverse opinions. This complex relationship highlights
            the possible impact on our critical thinking and decision-making
            abilities. The increasing tendency towards automation bias and
            limited exposure to diverse opinions interrogates on the prospective
            evolution in human cognition. The nature of human thought and
            experience is on the verge of substantial shift, with the potential
            emergence of limited perspectives and automated decision-making in a
            scenario where human consciousness is simulated in a digital realm,
            influenced by these prevalent patterns.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the book ‘The Age of Em', Robin Hanson's explores of the 'em'
            era; it involves emulating human minds onto computers, creating a
            world where biology meets the digital, pushing us into a speculative
            future where humans undergo a transformation by being emulated onto
            computers. This concept is not limited to a technological feat; it
            marks a paradigm shift in our understanding of existence and
            consciousness. In this scenario, the essence of what it means to be
            human exceeds its traditional boundaries. The 'emulated onto
            computers' notion challenges preconceived notions about the
            constraints of our physical bodies and the potential for
            consciousness to extend beyond biological confines. This futuristic
            scenario forces us to confront the implications for identity,
            cognition, and our subjective reality. As such, questions arise
            about the nature of consciousness, the preservation of memory, and
            the ethical considerations surrounding the fusion of human essence
            with computational machinery. In essence, 'emulated onto computers'
            invites us to envision a future where the boundaries between the
            organic and the artificial blur into a new human experience. Our
            fundamental assumptions about morality, progress, and identity are
            challenged in an era where humans are no longer limited by
            biological constraints but can exist as digital entities. Perhaps
            Hanson’s speculative thoughts on a future, in which digital bodies
            take over the physical aspects of being a human, isn’t so far from
            our present reality.
            <br />
            <br />

            Nicolas Carr's "The Glass Cage" offers a critical examination of
            automation's impact on various aspects of our lives.
            <a href="#Carr">(Carr, 2015)</a> Carr questions the hidden costs of
            convenience and efficiency when it comes to automating physical
            labour and delegating mental tasks. When we hand over tasks to
            machines, we run the risk of losing certain skills and diminishing
            our capacity for curiosity, imagination, and independence.
            <a href="#Carr">(Carr, 2015)</a> In that way, part of our physical
            functions is outsourced to technology, and we are one step closer to
            existing as Hanson’s digital emulations of human minds - these
            emulated minds, existing as digital entities, retain the cognitive
            abilities, memories, and consciousness of their human counterparts.
            <br />
            <br />

            The essence of progress and the values we hold dear are being
            questioned through this chapter. Pariser, Frischmann, Hanson, and
            Carr's narratives are signs that prompt us to consider the
            trade-offs in our technologically infused lives. We are faced with
            the delicate balance between progress and conserving what makes us
            distinctly human.

            Tim Wu's book 'Attention Merchants' explores the relationship
            between technology and human consciousness in the
            <span>attention economy</span><sup>10</sup>. From the early days of
            newspapers to the relentless bombardment of advertisements in the
            digital era <a href="#Wu">(Wu, 2017)</a>, attention has become a
            commodity traded for profit.
            <br />
            <br />

            The people who seek attention to influence behaviour, especially to
            drive purchases, are called Attention Merchants. This industry,
            emerging less than 200 years ago, traces its roots back to the first
            world war when propaganda campaigns marked the transition from
            forcefully taking the attention of the people to a more subtle
            approach. <a href="#Adeoti">(Adeoti, 2020)</a> In the early 1800s,

            Wu's book poses a polemic: the attention industry poses a threat to
            human happiness by inhibiting good attention, which is deep,
            long-lasting, and voluntary, while encouraging bad attention, which
            is quick, superficial, and often involuntarily provoked.
            <a href="Tarnoff">(Tarnoff, 2016)</a> Digital life is described as
            <span>corrupt</span><sup>11</sup> and is highlighted by the
            influence of the attention industry. The pervasive use of
            attention-grabbing techniques, often at the expense of users' time
            and focus, reflects a distortion of genuine, meaningful engagement
            with digital content. The corruption of the digital attention
            industry is no longer news. Wu’s description of it is almost a
            decade old and, although its relevance has persisted, if not
            increased, new complexities of ‘corruption’ in our digital lives
            have entered the picture. In Wu’s example, the user is the victim of
            the corruption and manipulation. But what happens when the user
            becomes an active part of corrupting?
            <br />

            Image manipulation, previously a skill perfected by professional
            editors, is entering the average smartphone users’ toolbox. Marques
            Brownlee, a YouTuber with grand success in reviewing the newest
            consumer electronics, examines a new flagship smartphone
            <a href="#Marques">(Marques Brownlee,2024)</a> that uses Artificial
            Intelligence powered by Google Cloud. The YouTube video introduces
            us to the interconnectedness of hardware that harnesses the power of
            the <span>Neural Processing Unit (NPU)</span><sup>12</sup>,
            revolutionises image processing capabilities. This new smartphone
            will have a transformative impact on mobile photography.
            <a href="#Adebanji">(Adebanji, 2024)</a> Changing the way
            individuals interact with and manipulate visual content, smartphone
            owners will not only be able to move, resize subjects, or completely
            remove them, it can also generate background and gaps one might have
            in their photos; the image manipulation offers a small opportunity
            to retouch parts of one’s own past. Thus, the ethical considerations
            surrounding AI in photography, from authenticity to representation
            and privacy, are serious.
            <a href="#Adebanji">(Adebanji, 2024)</a> The manipulation of memory
            brings up challenges with implications for both individual and
            collective narratives. The very nature of external algorithm created
            by corporation shape the way we recall and interpret our
            experiences. Beyond the immediate impact on personal recollections,
            there is a broader question about the elasticity of historical
            events in the digital age. As technology becomes an integral part of
            memory formation and preservation
            <a href="#Rational-Expressions">(Rational Expressions Inc., n.d.)</a
            >, AI-powered tools have the potential to alter memories by
            manipulating photographs and changing the visual representation of
            past events. <span>Memory distortion</span><sup>13</sup>, a natural
            part of building a coherent sense of self, encounters a double-edged
            sword as AI-powered tools offer both creative potential and ethical
            dilemmas.

            <br />
            <br />

            Users are taking on a more active role in manipulating thoughts and,
            particularly, memory through AI-generated imagery. Although it may
            seem like they have some control over creating and perfecting their
            past through these technologies, a deeper reflection reveals a more
            complex reality. Despite the appearance of empowerment, the user
            remains, in essence, a victim. The paradox begins with our desire to
            'perfect' and reshape our past, a narrative that was skilfully sold
            to us by the attention industry. The attention economy, driven by
            the relentless pursuit of profit, subtly planted the seed of
            discontent, convincing individuals that the idealised versions of
            their past could be achieved through the very tools now at their
            disposal. The blurring boundaries between user agency and industry
            influence leads to users being both orchestrators and subjects
            within memory manipulation.

            The intersection between human cognition and the external world
            leads to a multifaceted exploration of cognitive, emotional, and
            identity-related dimensions when technology and memory interact. The
            psychological effects of technology on memory extend beyond storage
            and retrieval, encompassing a transformative state of mind<sup

            within a broader narrative.
            <br />
            <br />
            Nicholas Carr's "The Glass Cage: Automation and Us" dives into the
            repercussions of automation on human cognition. He warns of
            cognitive disengagement<sup>15</sup> as technology assumes more
            cognitive tasks, leading to a state of mental passivity.
            <a href="#Carr">(Carr, 2015)</a> Carr argues that automation can
            narrow our perspectives, limit our choices, and, in turn, impact the
            depth and quality of our memories. The danger is not just about
            technology taking over cognitive tasks, but also about the decline
            of active, thoughtful engagement with the world.
            <br />
            <br />

            A lens through which we examine the personal emotional facets of
            technology-induced memory alteration is Björk's song” All is Full of
            Love". <a href="#Björk">(Björk, 2007)</a> The music video shows how
            technology and our emotional experiences come together in a
            harmonious yet unsettling convergence. The machine feels as human
            as, the human feels machine. The symbiosis between these two
            "species" is intricate. Through moments of harmony or tension, our
            emotional experiences and technology become connected and
            interdependent, resembling the yin and yang of ancient Chinese
            philosophy <a href="#Bellaimey">(Bellaimey, 2013)</a>. Consequently,
            introducing the topic of alienation in the digital age. The song "OK
            Computer" by Radiohead serves as a sonic exploration of a dystopian
            future shaped by technology. The album navigates through a narrative
            that explores the impact of technology on societal expectations and
            individual identity.
            <a href="#OK-Computer">(‘OK Computer’, 2024)</a> This exploration
            intersects with the construction of collective memories. Once again,
            the relationship to technology is portrayed as a harmonious
            collaboration, where the interplay of mutually beneficial aspects
            and contrasting forces shapes the dynamics between humans and
            technology.
            <br />
            <br />
            In our interaction with technology, we exercise control and
            authority, and with control comes the ability to choose. Computing
            operates on a binary basis, where the options are reduced to 0 or 1,
            representing yes or no. When applied to the idea of memory, this
            signifies the choice between preservation and erasure. The film
            “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" plunges us into the heart of
            memory manipulation technology.
            <a href="#Love">(‘Love, Memory, and Identity’, 2023)</a>> The films
            memory erasure procedure symbolises society's desire to escape
            emotional pain and unpleasant memories. Ultimately, the film prompts
            contemplation on the implications of selectively editing personal
            narratives. Acknowledging and integrating past experiences, even the
            painful ones, leads to growth. It raises the fundamental question:
            Can we truly be human without our memories? The Blade Runner saga,
            encompassing both its 1982 and 2017 iterations, extends this
            exploration by introducing artificial memories. In the original
            film, photographs are used because they are durable in their filmic
            structure much like memories—they serve as tangible proof that the
            past can be recollected with a degree of certainty. Capturing a
            moment through photography creates a feeling of reality; even if a
            photo fades, its existence remains. Blade Runner 2049, the sequel,
            is largely the story of a man sorting through pasts both real and
            manufactured to form a coherent identity. However, the nature of
            memory undergoes transformation in this sequel. The shift is
            attributed how memories are stored on the cloud, an online network
            of data storage. Just like the outsourced memories, such as
            remembering an event through an image, externalised data becomes
            susceptible to external influences, making it malleable, modifiable,
            and, at times, vulnerable to corruption. In that way, the process of
            memory corruption is comparable to a dropped vase —the memories may
            shatter into myriad pieces, but their presence persists. In the film
            Inception, 2010, the audience is plunged into a world where
            individuals can enter dreams and manipulate the subconscious,
            leading to an examination of memory, reality, and identity.
            <a href="#Sumner">(Sumner, 2017)</a> Our understanding of selfhood
            is intricately tied to the memories we carry. Memories serve as the
            building blocks of personal identity. The manipulation of memories
            in the dream world directly impact the stability and coherence of
            personal identity. Authentic or manipulated, memories bear an
            emotional weight on one's being. When the line between reality and
            the subconscious are blurred, the psychological toll of navigating a
            world where memory itself becomes a construct is accentuated. In
            inception, the dream world becomes a canvas where the mind paints
            and erases, challenging conventional notions of a fixed reality.
            Thus, the essence of identity lies not solely in memories but rather
            in the interpretation of these memories; one's identity is
            intricately tied to the subjective lens through which memories are
            perceived and understood. When memories are subject to manipulation,
            the very core of identity is called into question.

          <p>
            In a future lead by humans in symbiosis with technology, several
            possibilities are at the forefront: the evolution of the
            Mechanically Extended Man<sup>16</sup>,
            <a href="#Licklider">(Licklider, 1960)</a> a human-machine symbiosis
            and BCIs<sup>17</sup> influencing the temporal dimensions<sup
              >18</sup
            >
            of our memories.
            <br />
            <br />

            A scope towards our immediate future leads us to the concept of the
            Mechanically Extended Man; envisioning a future where technology
            augments capacities, while respecting individual autonomy. Its
            presence is already evident in industries like machining, where
            operators oversee machines that cannot be fully automated. This
            application reflects the essence of respecting individual autonomy.
            As this concept continues to evolve, it remains user-centric,
            designed to enhance experiences without overshadowing human agency.
            This balanced evolution points to a future where technology
            empowers, coexisting harmoniously with nuanced human control.
            <br />
            <br />

            Yet, the trends in new technologies points towards a seamless
            integration of wearables, ranging from smart watches to brain-
            computer interfaces, into our existence. The concept of
            human-machine symbiosis goes beyond conventional interactions - its
            integration is so smooth that technology becomes an extension of the
            user, influencing and enhancing various aspects of our cognitive
            functions and daily activities. Neurotechnological advancements
            enable direct interactions between minds and technology, this could
            allow for collaborative memory projects and interconnected
            ecosystems, for a collective consciousness enhancing the collective
            understanding of the subject. Imagine a scenario where individuals,
            equipped with BCIs
            <a href="#Emotiv">(Emotiv, n.d.)</a>, can participate in collective
            memory initiatives, presenting a use case that surpasses the current
            capabilities of such devices. For instance, a research project
            focused on understanding historical events could involve
            participants sharing their recollections related to a particular
            period. Digitally stored and transferred memories will then make up
            a comprehensive and interconnected database. Thus enabling, a
            collective consciousness that enhances our collective understanding
            of various subjects.
            <br />
            <br />

            However, due to these new possibilities, ethical considerations may
            emerge. Notably in the regard of individual identity. The
            interaction between temporal dynamics, human-machine integration and
            perception, is complex in nature. As computers operate quickly and
            memories evolve, we find ourselves simultaneously recalling and
            envisioning the past. This investigation encourages reflection on
            the ethical dimensions of temporal experiences. One key aspect is
            the ethical use of technology to influence the way individuals
            experience and understand time. This raises questions about privacy,
            consent, and the potential impact on personal making independent
            decisions and controlling our own actions without external
            interference. By allowing technologies, such as television, and
            applications, such as Instagram and YouTube, to access and
            manipulate temporal data the ethical dimensions extend to societal
            implications - the adoption of these technologies may lead to
            societal shifts in how people relate to time, altering cultural
            norms and values.
